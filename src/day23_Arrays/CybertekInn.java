            the program asks the user which bedroom does he/she wants to reserve and calculats the total price
            and then the program will ask:
                do you want to reserve another room:
                            if yes ==> repeat the previous steps
                            if no ==> your total price is: $$$
                            while answer is neither yes or no ==> please re-enter
            HINT: nested loop task, outter loop need to be an infinite loop
